    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Triple cooked fries are a type of French fry that is made by cooking 
        the potatoes three times using different methods 
        to achieve a crispy exterior and a fluffy interior. 
        The first cooking involves simmering the sliced potatoes 
        in water until they are tender <i>but not falling apart</i>. 
        The second cooking involves frying the potatoes in oil at a low temperature 
        to remove any excess moisture and create a slightly crispy exterior. 
        The third and final cooking involves frying the potatoes again at a higher temperature 
        to create a <strong>crispy golden-brown</strong> exterior.</p>
